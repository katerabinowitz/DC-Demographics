Ladd Forrester: \"Eventually the Chicken Hut opened across from Lafayette Square, drawing the pianist Howard away to play there instead.  Howard played there seven nights a week until one night, in the mid-1970s, he died at the bar's keyboard.\" Behind the Roger Smith hotel.  \"It was the center of gay social life in the late 40s and 50s.  On Fridays and Saturdays, the place was 'packed to the rafters'.\"--Brett Beemyn.  \"It was the Chicken Hut, at 1720 H St NW.  They had (bi?) weekly Sunday afternoon dances during the winter of 1961-62.  To the best of my knowledge, no special license was needed, but I'm not sure.\"--Franklin E Kameny.",

Judy, the very popular waitress/bartender, started working here in 1964 (she later worked at the Court Jester, Onyx, Cy's, and the Fireplace).  Just Us:  “One of DC’s standard gay bars, the Grill (or affectionately, Greta’s) features a jukebox in a crowded but quiet atmosphere which is easy for talking.  Drinks are notably reasonably priced.  A fine place to spend a weekend afternoon ‘window shopping’ the passersby on crowded Wisconsin Avenue, the heart of the Georgetown shopping district.  No cover, reservations, or dancing, but a steady regular crowd of loyal patrons, tourists, and college students, mostly male and all gay.  The ever popular Block is nearby.”",

I believe that the Hideaway was still in operation when the FBI building opened, and I remember hearing stories of FBI agents and other FBI employees having lunch there, before it shifted over, each day, for its evening gay operation.\"  Just Us:  “A small discotheque in its twelfth year of operation, the Hideaway has intimate tables, shuffleboard, pinball machines, and a jukebox for dancing.  This all contributes to its easy-going atmosphere.  Do cover, no reservations for this predominantly male and highly mixed bar.  One of DC’s standards.

Just Us:  “The Plus One is the first of the Capital City’s superbars, and is still a front runner in many ways.  Weekends, breakfast is served from 3:00 am to  6:00 am.  Happy Hour continues seven days a week.  18-year olds are welcome.  Membership in the Gatsby Club is ten dollars annually.  The Gatsby Club offers members half-price admission to the Thursday night shows, free movies, and often, breakfast and buffets.  The crowd is predominantly gay but otherwise mixed.”",

David Harris, owner, opened the baths in an old warehouse.  ‘Liz Taylor’ and ‘Judy Garland’ of the Oscars drag group helped in setting up and decorating the baths.  There was a large Roman style mural in the bath area.  Harris had many run-ins with the police who regularly harassed the Regency.  On several occasions the Regency has special women-only nights.  Annual memberships were $12 and the nightly cover was $3.  The Regency was known in later days as a 'hustler' bathhouse, but also as a place where 'street people' could stay the night.  It was indicted as a 'bawdy house' in the 70s and Harris paid a $500 fine. The first of the bathhouses to close during the AIDS epidemic.  Harris also opened Regency bathhouses in Miami, Norfolk, and Boston.  Just Us:  “The Regency is a club open to members only, but membership is open to anyone.  Rates are fifteen dollars a year and are payable in installments.  The club is open 24 hours a day.”",

They put in a small dance floor, which immediately started to attract business including, (I think) some men.  Johnnies saw the future, and installed a postage-stamp-sized dance floor, and began getting lots of customers.\"--Franklin Kameny.  JoAnna's closed briefly.  The re-opened JoAnna's in 1973 hosted Paul & Billie Gold's Gold Dust Review on Sundays.  (See also entries for Horseshoe Saloon; Rendezvous.)",

The Grill was also a performance space for the popular Red Shoes Walking troupe.  Judy, the very popular waitress/bartender, started working here in 1964 (she later worked at the Court Jester, Onyx, Cy's, and the Fireplace).  Just Us:  “One of DC’s standard gay bars, the Grill (or affectionately, Greta’s) features a jukebox in a crowded but quiet atmosphere which is easy for talking.  Drinks are notably reasonably priced.  A fine place to spend a weekend afternoon ‘window shopping’ the passersby on crowded Wisconsin Avenue, the heart of the Georgetown shopping district.  No cover, reservations, or dancing, but a steady regular crowd of loyal patrons, tourists, and college students, mostly male and all gay.  The ever popular Block is nearby.”",

I believe that the Hideaway was still in operation when the FBI building opened, and I remember hearing stories of FBI agents and other FBI employees having lunch there, before it shifted over, each day, for its evening gay operation.\"  Just Us:  “A small discotheque in its twelfth year of operation, the Hideaway has intimate tables, shuffleboard, pinball machines, and a jukebox for dancing.  This all contributes to its easy-going atmosphere.  Do cover, no reservations for this predominantly male and highly mixed bar.  One of DC’s standards.

Just Us:  “The Plus One is the first of the Capital City’s superbars, and is still a front runner in many ways.  Weekends, breakfast is served from 3:00 am to  6:00 am.

David Harris, owner, opened the baths in an old warehouse.  ‘Liz Taylor’ and ‘Judy Garland’ of the Oscars drag group helped in setting up and decorating the baths.  There was a large Roman style mural in the bath area.  Harris had many run-ins with the police who regularly harassed the Regency.  On several occasions the Regency has special women-only nights.  Annual memberships were $12 and the nightly cover was $3.  The Regency was known in later days as a 'hustler' bathhouse, but also as a place where 'street people' could stay the night.  It was indicted as a 'bawdy house' in the 70s and Harris paid a $500 fine. The first of the bathhouses to close during the AIDS epidemic.  Harris also opened Regency bathhouses in Miami, Norfolk, and Boston.  Just Us:  “The Regency is a club open to members only, but membership is open to anyone.  Rates are fifteen dollars a year and are payable in installments.  The club is open 24 hours a day.”",

Just Us (1974):  “Glitter, fashion, and jammy music are the general rule at the Pier, but anything goes.  Two dance floors (upstairs and down) and a number of bars, and a restaurant serving dinner, pizzas, and ‘heavenly burgers’ are some specialties.  One dollar cover on Friday and Saturday.”  “Given its relatively isolated location, it gave us a sense of security that more in-town locations couldn’t”—Peter Jefts.",

I believe that the Hideaway was still in operation when the FBI building opened, and I remember hearing stories of FBI agents and other FBI employees having lunch there, before it shifted over, each day, for its evening gay operation.\"  Just Us:  “A small discotheque in its twelfth year of operation, the Hideaway has intimate tables, shuffleboard, pinball machines, and a jukebox for dancing.  This all contributes to its easy-going atmosphere.  Do cover, no reservations for this predominantly male and highly mixed bar.  One of DC’s standards.  Downstairs from Louie’s and the Barn.”  Out:  “D.C.’s grooviest corner.”",

Replaced by Quorum in 1991, the name was resurrected in 1993 when Quorum changed its name back to Lost and Found.  Replaced by the Edge.  Just Us:  “Quiet elegance in dining and décor with good disco music re the trademarks of the Lost and Found.  Live band Sunday at 3:00 pm for the tea dance.  No cover except on Halloween and New Year’s.  Reservations are definitely in order for dinner.  Men and women have separate bar areas with different atmosphere, but mingling is constant.  Free popcorn, old prices Tuesday through Thursday nights, pool tables are some special features.  (See also entry for Edge; Quorum; Wet; Zone.)",

David Harris, owner, opened the baths in an old warehouse.  ‘Liz Taylor’ and ‘Judy Garland’ of the Oscars drag group helped in setting up and decorating the baths.  There was a large Roman style mural in the bath area.  Harris had many run-ins with the police who regularly harassed the Regency.  On several occasions the Regency has special women-only nights.  Annual memberships were $12 and the nightly cover was $3.  The Regency was known in later days as a 'hustler' bathhouse, but also as a place where 'street people' could stay the night.  It was indicted as a 'bawdy house' in the 70s and Harris paid a $500 fine. The first of the bathhouses to close during the AIDS epidemic.  Harris also opened Regency bathhouses in Miami, Norfolk, and Boston.  Just Us:  “The Regency is a club open to members only, but membership is open to anyone.  Rates are fifteen dollars a year and are payable in installments.  The club is open 24 hours a day.”",

Original owners: Donn Culver & Bill Bickford (who later opened the Lost & Found). The Pier had a second floor dance area, a popular restaurant, and in the 70s an area on the ground floor for those under the legal drinking age.   The Pier 9 was the first gay dance club in the South Capitol St. area.  In 1975, the Washington Square opened on the other side of South Capital St. at 1345 Half St SE.  Just Us (1974):  “Glitter, fashion, and jammy music are the general rule at the Pier, but anything goes.  Two dance floors (upstairs and down) and a number of bars, and a restaurant serving dinner, pizzas, and ‘heavenly burgers’ are some specialties.  One dollar cover on Friday and Saturday.”  “Given its relatively isolated location, it gave us a sense of security that more in-town locations couldn’t”—Peter Jefts.",

Replaced by Quorum in 1991, the name was resurrected in 1993 when Quorum changed its name back to Lost and Found.  Replaced by the Edge.  Just Us:  “Quiet elegance in dining and décor with good disco music re the trademarks of the Lost and Found.  Live band Sunday at 3:00 pm for the tea dance.  No cover except on Halloween and New Year’s.  Reservations are definitely in order for dinner.  Men and women have separate bar areas with different atmosphere, but mingling is constant.  Free popcorn, old prices Tuesday through Thursday nights, pool tables are some special features.  (See also entry for Edge; Quorum; Wet; Zone.)",
