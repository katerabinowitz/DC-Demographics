The Pier had a second floor dance area, a popular restaurant, and in the 70s an area on the ground floor for those under the legal drinking age.   The Pier 9 was the first gay dance club in the South Capitol St. area.  In 1975, the Washington Square opened on the other side of South Capital St. at 1345 Half St SE.  Just Us (1974):  “Glitter, fashion, and jammy music are the general rule at the Pier, but anything goes.  Two dance floors (upstairs and down) and a number of bars, and a restaurant serving dinner, pizzas, and ‘heavenly burgers’ are some specialties.  One dollar cover on Friday and Saturday.”  “Given its relatively isolated location, it gave us a sense of security that more in-town locations couldn’t”—Peter Jefts.", "Gender": "MW", "Ethnicity": "Mixed", "Date.Opened": "1970", "Date.Closed": "1986", "yrOpen": "70", "yrClose": "86", "decadeOpen": 1970.000000, "decadeClose": 1980.000000, "singleOut": "SW", "decade": "1980" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 38.867474, -77.0104392 ] } },
